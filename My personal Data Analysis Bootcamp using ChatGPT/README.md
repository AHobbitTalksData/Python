I created this 12-week data analysis bootcamp focused on Python by using ChatGPT. The curriculum covered essential libraries like Pandas, Scikit, Numpy, SQL, BeautifulSoup, and machine learning concepts. Each week focused on specific topics, with hands-on projects to reinforce learning. I explored data manipulation, machine learning, numerical operations, SQL database interactions, web scraping, and data visualization.

You can find the curriculum for the bootcamp in my blog, specifically, [this is the post](https://jessyacunarodriguez.wixsite.com/a-hobbit-talks-data/post/the-personalized-python-data-analysis-bootcamp-i-crafted-using-chatgpt). 

I will be posting a Jupyter notebook that contains the theory I have gathered, and also the project for that respective week.
